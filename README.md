bugs/todo

1. last changed date wrong // On second look this doesn't really make much sense, the age is more important / equivalent to last changed. Except in the edge case of a good deal becoming unavailable
        //and defaulting back to an older deal, but in that case, that is actually the more important information that we cannot currently derive.
